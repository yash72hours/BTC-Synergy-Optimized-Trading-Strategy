## Strategy Overview

The **Crypto Synergy Optimizer** is a sophisticated technical analysis-driven strategy tailored for trading Bitcoin on a daily time frame. It combines several classic and advanced indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic Relative Strength Index (StochRSI), and Average True Range (ATR) to optimize trade entries, exits, and risk management. This synergy of indicators forms a balanced system that adapts to varying market conditions, identifying both trend-following opportunities and potential reversals.

### Key Components

1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**
   - The strategy employs a fast (15-period) and slow (22-period) Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to calculate the MACD. The difference between the fast and slow EMAs provides insight into market momentum, while the 9-period signal line helps confirm trend changes and crossovers to trigger trades.
  
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index):**
   - The strategy utilizes a 21-period RSI to measure the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 70 indicates overbought conditions, while an RSI below 30 signals oversold conditions, helping to fine-tune entry and exit points.
     
3. **Stochastic RSI (StochRSI):**
   - The 7-period StochRSI is used to detect overbought and oversold conditions, allowing the strategy to pinpoint potential reversal points. The K and D lines (3-period and 2-period smoothed) help fine-tune entry and exit signals.

4. **ATR (Average True Range):**
   - The 8-period ATR is used to measure market volatility and adjust stop-loss levels dynamically. By multiplying the ATR by a factor of 1.5, the strategy ensures that stop losses are positioned far enough to avoid getting hit by random volatility while protecting capital from larger moves against the trade.

5. **Risk and Trade Management:**
   - **Stop Loss:** Fixed at 3% below the entry price for long positions.
   - **Take Profit:** A dynamic take-profit target of 7.5% is used for both long and short positions, ensuring optimal reward-to-risk ratios.
   - **Weight Signal:** A multiplier of 2 is used to adjust the strength of signals based on the confidence from the indicators, which further refines trade execution.

6. **Candle-Based Entry/Exit Delays:**
   - The strategy introduces a one-candle delay after signals to reduce false entries and ensure that the market's direction is confirmed before entering a position.

### Trade Execution Flow

- **Entry Conditions:**
  The algorithm follows a weighted strategy system and is based on a combination of well-documented indicators. First, the algorithm calculated the weight_strategy, which represents a value from 0 to 5 of the number of fulfilled strategies. To open a position, the value of weight_strategy must be greater than the value of weight_signal, by default 2.

- **Exit Conditions:**
  - Take profit is executed when the price hits 7.5% above/below the entry price.
  - A stop loss is placed 3% away from the entry price to protect against adverse market moves.
